<h3>Marketing plan </h3>
<p> The marketing plan is very simple and gives the opportunity to earn on commission, calculated based on sponsor’s turnover and his/her group. The points are calculated monthly. In order to reach the percentage level, the distributor with his/her group should get the certain amount of points from the  table. You receive points for each purchased product. That is calculated on bonus. E.g. how many bottles of perfumes should the distributor buy with his/her group to reach the next percentage level.
