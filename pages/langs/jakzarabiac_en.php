Every client wants to smell the fragrances, that she wants to buy, that’ s why it’s worth having the starter. We propose 2 types of starter sets, - <strong>the Complete Collection Starter Kit</strong> containing everything you need to start developing your FM business.

            <li> Commission  from the marketing plan (e.g. 17  bottles of perfumes- this is 300 points, it means 3%bonus). Payoff for the distributor is counted by multiplying of purchase size (in points) by percentage value.  </li>
            <li>Other additional programs organized by FM Group

 <br />    

<h3>Marketing plan </h3>
<p> The marketing plan is very simple and gives the opportunity to earn on commission, calculated based on sponsor’s turnover and his/her group. The points are calculated monthly. In order to reach the percentage level, the distributor with his/her group should get the certain amount of points from the  table. You receive points for each purchased product. That is calculated on bonus. E.g. how many bottles of perfumes should the distributor buy with his/her group to reach the next percentage level.
